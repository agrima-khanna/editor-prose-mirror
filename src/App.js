      <h2>
        Hi there,
      </h2>
      <p>
        this is a <em>basic</em> example of <strong>tiptap</strong>. Sure, there are all kind of basic text styles you‚Äôd probably expect from a text editor. But wait until you see the lists:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          That‚Äôs a bullet list with one ‚Ä¶
        </li>
        <li>
          ‚Ä¶ or two list items.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Isn‚Äôt that great? And all of that is editable. But wait, there‚Äôs more. Let‚Äôs try a code block:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-css">body {
  display: none;
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        I know, I know, this is impressive. It‚Äôs only the tip of the iceberg though. Give it a try and click a little bit around. Don‚Äôt forget to check the other examples too.
      </p>
